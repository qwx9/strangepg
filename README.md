# strange pangenome scale visualization

Huge graph interactive visualization Ã  la [Bandage](https://github.com/rrwick/Bandage).
Currently supports graphs in [GFAv1](https://github.com/GFA-spec/GFA-spec/blob/master/GFA1.md) format.

Sales pitch:
```
Visualizing large graphs in the million node scale and beyond remains a challenge and is relevant to multiple fields of study. In
pangenomics, as databases are continuously enriched by new and high quality assemblies, there is a growing need for tools and
methods tailored to handle extremely large volumes of data. As pangenome sizes multiply, available techniques quickly hit
operational limits in terms of processing time and memory. In particular, visualizing graphs in a general, intuitive and interactive
manner is useful for analysis and interpretation, yet computationally prohibitive at such a scale. The main objective of this
project is the development of strangepg, a new tool and visualization workflow aiming to address these limitations by employing
the combination of offline indexing and graph coarsening with the extensive use of a generic external memory layer. By
offloading the major computational effort to a preprocessing step, the interactive visualizer loads only a small fraction of the
total data and fetches more from disk only on request. The use of external memory ensures that every step can be performed on
commodity hardware for arbitrary sized graphs. strangepg is being implemented in C in a highly modular, portable and
extensible manner, designed to allow substituting different algorithms for most steps with minimal effort, and aims to provide a
general framework for experimentation with layouting and new visualization techniques.

## Installation

Currently only Linux (and 9front) are supported. For now, it has to be
installed from source by cloning the repository then building the software.

Coming soon: macos, binary and conda packages.

Planned: BSDs, switch (nx) and aarch64 ports.

### Compilation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/qwx9/strangepg
cd strangepg
make -j install
```

_-j_ is an optional flag to enable parallel building using all available cores.
This installs the binaries ```strpg``` and ```strawk```,
by default in *$HOME/.local/bin*.
If this directory is not in your $PATH or a different installation directory is desired,
see the `Additional compilation settings` section below.

### Dependencies

Full list (ubuntu package names):

- libbsd0
- libgl-dev
- libglvnd-dev
- libglx-dev
- libmd0
- libx11-dev
- libxau-dev
- libxcb1-dev
- libxcursor-dev
- libxdmcp-dev
- libxext-dev
- libxfixes-dev
- libxi-dev
- libxrandr-dev

Most of these would be installed already on a typical Linux system.
Command line (adapt to your system):
```bash
apt install libbsd0 libgl-dev libglvnd-dev libglx-dev libmd0 libx11-dev libxau-dev libxcb1-dev libxcursor-dev libxdmcp-dev libxext-dev libxfixes-dev libxi-dev libxrandr-dev 
```

Tested with gcc 11.4.0 and 13.2.0, and clang 14.0.0 and 17.0.6
on Voidlinux and lubuntu.

## Usage

_strangepg_ requires at least one input file as argument.
It currently supports graphs in GFA format.

```bash
strpg file.gfa
```

Some test examples exist in the `test/` directory.
For example:

```bash
strpg test/03.232.gfa
```

### Command-line options

- -b:	white-on-black theme
- -c file.csv:	load metadata tags from csv file (see format below)
- -f file:	load exported layout from file
- -t nth:	number of layouting workers (default: 4)
- -l alg:	select layouting algorithm (see Layouts below) (default: fr)
- -R:	do not reset layout once metadata is done loading

## Layouts

_strangepg_ ships with a few selectable layouting algorithms currently all based
on a spring model force-directed approach.
Select one with the *-l* option.
Layouting preallocates a pool of worker threads, but depending on the algorithm,
only one worker may be active. The default is 4, changed via the *-t* option:

```bash
# example: parallel FR layout with 8 workers: 
strpg -l pfr -t 8 file.gfa
```

Available layouts:

- _fr_: Fruchterman-Reingold-based layout (default)
- _pfr_: parallel version of the above
- _conga_: fixed node placement on a line by GFA file order
- _random_: random fixed node placement

Experimental, problem-specific layouts:
- _linear_: _fr_ layout with the addition of optionally fixed position nodes (_fx_ and _fy_ GFA segment tags) and initial position (via _mv_ segment tag)
- _pline_: parallel version of the above
- _circ_: attempt at a circular version of the above
- _bo_: similar to _pline_ but using BO tags for initial placement along a horizontal line

A pre-existing layout may be loaded with the `-f` flag irrespective of the selected layout algorithm.
Layouts can't yet be selected at runtime or ran partially but they may be interrupted and resumed with the 'p' key.

The current layout may be exported or imported at runtime with the `exportlayout("file")` and `importlayout("file")` functions
(see the Interaction section below).
The output file format is binary.

Termination conditions for the algorithms are not yet well tuned wrt. the size of
the graphs, and layouting may continue with little noticeable changes.
Use the 'p' key to freeze/unfreeze layouting.

## Navigation

Mouse buttons:

- Select object: click left mouse button (click on nothing to unselect)
- Move (pan) view: drag with right mouse button or press a cursor key to jump
- Zoom view: three options:
	* mouse scroll keys
	* hold control + right mouse
	* hold left + right mouse button and drag: pull (drag towards bottom right) to zoom in, push (draw towards top left) to zoom out

Keyboard shortcuts:

- Pause/unpause layout: 'p' key
- Re-layout: 'r' key
- Quit: 'q' key or close window
- Reset initial position: 'escape' key
- Arrow keys: move view by screenful in cardinal direction

Selecting an object currently only shows the selection on stdandard out,
but will be shown in the prompt window soon.

## Interaction

_strangepg_ provides a text prompt for interaction with the graph by issuing commands.
They are effectively [_awk_](https://awk.dev) one-liners.
GFA tags and labels are transformed into tables which can then be used to change the state of the graph in arbitrary ways.
For more in-depth information, check out [the help document](strawk.md).

### Examples

Color every other node in red:
```awk
for(i in node) if(i % 2 == 1) nodecolor(i, red)
```

Color nodes with sequence length > 50:
```awk
for(i in node) if(LN[i] > 50) nodecolor(i, red)
```

Color based on if-elseif-else pattern:
```awk
for(i in LN) nodecolor(i, LN[i] > 200 ? red : LN[i] > 50 ? green : blue)
```

Color nodes with labels matching a regexp:
```awk
for(i in node) if(i ~ /chr13/) nodecolor(i, red)
```

Currently most of the functionality is limited to coloring, but editing the graph is next.
Note that the language is admittedly cumbersome for this purpose and is not final.


## Loading tags from CSV files

CSV files can be loaded at start up or at runtime to feed or modify tags for existing nodes.
The first column is always reserved for node labels, and all subsequent columns are tags values.
The first line must be a header specifying a tag name for each column.

For example:
```
Node,CN,CO,CL
utig4-142,1,55231,purple
utig4-143,0,53,red
...
```

The name of the first column does not matter.
The `CL` tag is used as a node's color and can thus also be set in this way.
Nodes labels must refer to existing nodes in the input GFA file.

A csv file may be loaded at runtime with the `readcsv("file.csv")` command
(see the Interaction section).

### Format notes

The accepted format here is more stringent than usual.
The implementation is not localized, ie. commas are always field separators.
There are no escape sequences or special quoting rules, ie. quotes are not special characters.
Line breaks within a field are disallowed.
Lines must be terminated with a new line (LF) character, ie. the return character (CR) is not handled.

Each line must have the same number of fields as the header, but fields can be empty.

## Additional compilation settings

### Installation prefix

By default, the installation path is *$HOME/.local/bin*.
To install to a different directory, use the _PREFIX_ make variable:

```bash
# example: install in /usr/local/bin via sudo:
make -j
sudo make PREFIX=/usr/local install
```

### Compiler

To build using a different compiler, eg. clang, use the _CC_ make variable:

```bash
make CC=clang -j
sudo make PREFIX=/usr/local install
```

Tested with clang and gcc only.

## Known bugs

- node orientation is based on layout displacement direction as opposed to
  edges, a recent regression
- strawk leaks memory on each query because of the hack `eval` implementation;
  the parse tree is not supposed to be modified once generated and this needs
  to be done more intelligently
- Linux: keyboard/mouse handling are in the same thread as the renderer due to
  limitations of the bundled graphics library; this limitation reduces
  responsiveness and will be lifted once the renderer is rewritten

## 9front

Build with _mk_ instead of _make_ in the usual manner.
Additionally requires [npe](https://git.sr.ht/~ft/npe); it's really only required to build khash.
A better solution might exist since neither SDL2 isn't used at all.
